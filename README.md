# Can you feel it ?

Fillit puts up to 26 Tetriminos in the smallest possible square.
It takes only 1 parameter that is the file with all Tetriminos.

Build the project with : make && make clean

Then run it : ./fillit file

The extern_file.txt is a map containing 26 Tetriminos (you can modify it as you want)
